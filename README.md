Git clone this repo and start it to see what it does. Build the same features you see on the challenge app, starting with the code from [redux tutorial](http://redux.js.org/docs/basics/ExampleTodoList.html).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
